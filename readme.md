## Progress
### Phase 1 tasks (11/04 - 13/04) - Done
- Ngô Đa Báu
    - Learn and implement a basic search engine
    - Generate or gather academic documents for universities (stored as text files).
- Nguyễn Văn Chiến (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r5ub6TMLJNeTc8KTuxTEhqJeb2-vHstA)
    - Design a basic document management model for the university
    - Draw a schema for the above model (using ER model or relational model)
    - Describe constraints (if any)
    - Draw a class diagram for the above model.

### Phase 2 tasks (14/04 - 20/04)
- Ngô Đa Báu
    - Continue building search engine
    - Apply SOLID principles, dependency injection principles
    - Demonstrate compliance with OOP principles and principles, use design patterns
- Nguyễn Văn Chiến
    - Implement the designed model - basic document management for university
    - Apply SOLID principles, dependency injection principles
    - Demonstrate compliance with OOP principles and principles, use design patterns

## Project Proposal  
### Introduction  
Search Engine Project is an academic search engine application designed to search relevant academic information and records in universities. With this application, **students** in universities can search academic information based on keywords and titles provided for search.  

Most universities have their own websites that provide information regarding students' research papers, project source codes and project reports. These records can be used as a reference by new students entering universities. This search engine provides a platform to find out such records, information and data that can help students in the academic works.  

### Describe  
This project is expected to include the following components:  
- University Management System to organize and manage university-specific data.
- Documentation system of each university (stored as text files) for easy access.
- Search Algorithms, such as keyword-based or semantic search, to retrieve relevant academic information efficiently.
- Records management system to save and manage user search history for future reference.
- An infrastructure to support system operations, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- A Simple User Interface (CLI or web-based) to allow users to interact with the system intuitively.

### Detail  
After this project is finished, the program might operate as follows:  
1. You enter a word or phrase to search for academic information.
2. This search will be saved in the records management system.
3. The search algorithm processes the query and retrieves relevant results.
4. The Command Line Interface (CLI) displays a list of results.
5. You have the following options:
    - View or download one of the results.
    - Continue searching with a new query.
    - Exit the program.
