Linux/Unix Tutorial

Linux is a widely-used open-source operating system, similar to Windows, Mac, and Android. It shares 
similarities with Unix, another operating system known for its commercial use. Unix and Linux have 
comparable components, including the kernel, shell, and programs. Many commands in Unix and Linux 
exhibit similar behavior and syntax.

What is Linux Used For? – Linux is mostly used in servers, cloud computing, supercomputers, embedded 
systems, and developer environments. Its reliability, scalability, and security make it the backbone 
of web hosting, data centers, and IoT devices

Learn Basic Commands: Familiarize yourself with essential commands like ls, cd, pwd, cp, mv, rm, and mkdir. Practice navigating directories and managing files.
Explore the File System: Understand the Linux file structure, including /home, /var, /etc, and /usr. Learn how permissions work using chmod, chown, and ls -l.
Work with Text Editors: Get comfortable with terminal-based editors like Vim or Nano for creating and editing files.
Understand Package Management: Learn how to install, update, and remove software using package managers like apt (Debian-based) or yum/dnf (Red Hat-based).
Explore Shell Scripting: Start writing basic shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks and understand how shell scripting integrates with Linux commands.
Manage Processes and Services: Use commands like ps, top, and kill to manage processes and explore system services using systemctl.
Networking in Linux: Understand networking basics like IP configuration (ifconfig or ip), checking connectivity (ping), and managing firewall settings (ufw or iptables).
Learn Advanced Tools: Explore tools like grep, awk, sed, and cron for text processing and task scheduling.
Work on Real Projects: Set up a web server using Apache or Nginx, configure SSH for remote access, or create a simple home automation script.
Stay Updated: Regularly practice and stay updated with the latest Linux features, commands, and best practices by joining Linux forums and following tutorials.
