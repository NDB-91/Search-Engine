Lenin said I know that philosophers are going to accuse my materialism of being ‘metaphysical’ But he I do not ‘philosophize’ like them at all Their way of ‘philosophizing’ is to expend fortunes of intelligence and subtlety for no other purpose than to ruminate in philosophy Whereas I treat philosophy I practise as Marx in obedience to what it is That is why I believe I am a ‘dialectical materialist’ Materialism and Empirio criticism contains all either directly or between the lines And that is why Lenin the philosopher is intolerable to most who do not want to i e who realize without admitting that this is the real question The real question is not whether Engels and Lenin are or are not real whether their philosophical statements are formally whether they do or do not make foolish statements about Kant’s ‘thing in whether their materialism is or is not pre etc For all these questions are and always have been posed inside a certain practice of philosophy The real question bears precisely on this traditional practice which Lenin brings back into question by proposing a quite different practice of philosophy This different practice contains something like a promise or outline of an objective knowledge of philosophy’s mode of being A knowledge of philosophy as a Holzweg der Holzwege But the last thing philosophers and philosophy can the is perhaps precisely the idea of this knowledge What philosophy cannot bear is the idea of a since it lives by its denegation So academic philosophy cannot tolerate which are really one and the same On the one it cannot bear the idea that it might have something to learn from politics and from a politician And on the other it cannot bear the idea that philosophy might be the object of a i e of an objective knowledge That into the it should be a politician like an ‘innocent’ and an auto didact in philosophy who had the audacity to suggest the idea that a theory of philosophy is essential to a really conscious and responsible practice of is obviously too much whether academic or is not because this encounter hits the the most sensitive the point of the the point of the which traditionally philosophy has merely ruminated – precisely the point at in order to know itself in its philosophy has to recognize that it is no more than a certain investment of a certain continuation of a certain rumination of politics Lenin happens to have been the first to say so It also happens that he could say so only because he was a and not just any but a proletarian leader That is why Lenin is intolerable to philosophical as intolerable – and I choose my words carefully – as Freud is to psychological rumination It is clear that between Lenin and established philosophy there are not just misunderstandings and incidental not even just the philosophy professors’ reactions of wounded sensibility when the son of a a petty lawyer who became a revolutionary declares bluntly that most of them are petty bourgeois intellectuals functioning in the bourgeois education system as so many ideologists inculcating the mass of student youth with the dogmas – however critical or post critical – of the ideology of the ruling classes[4] Between Lenin and established philosophy there is a peculiarly intolerable we must go back a little before discussing Lenin and philosophy in we have to establish Lenin’s place in Marxist and therefore to raise the question of the state of Marxist philosophy I cannot hope to outline the history of Marxist philosophy here I am in no position to do and for an altogether determinant and if I knew I would also have to be in a position to know whether this X has or has not a i e whether it has or has not the right to a History Rather than even very the ‘history’ of Marxist I should like to demonstrate the existence of a symptomatic in the light of a sequence of texts and works in History This difficulty has given rise to famous disputes which have lasted to the present day The names most often given to these disputes signal its the ‘philosophy of praxis’ – but then what of the scientific claims made by Marx Is on the at heart a historical the science of history – but then what of its dialectical materialism Or if we accept the classical distinction between historical how are we to think this what are the relations between materialism and the dialectic in dialectical materialism Or what is the of which the classical questions that I have just recalled are a certain i e a certain interpretation Speaking very the classical formulations interpret this difficulty solely in terms of philosophical i e inside what I have called philosophical rumination – whereas it is undoubtedly necessary to think these difficulties and the philosophical questions which they cannot fail to in quite different i e of is it possible to understand the confusion that has led people to think in terms of prematurely philosophical questions the essential theoretical contribution of Marxism to i e the insistence of a certain problem which may well produce philosophical but only insofar as it is not itself in the last instance a philosophical question If I have deliberately used terms which presuppose certain this is not so as to pass judgement on those who have been subject to this for we are all subject to it and we all have every reason to think that it was and still is inevitable – so much so that Marxist philosophy itself has been and still is caught in for necessary reasons For a glance at the theatre of what is called Marxist philosophy since the Theses on Feuerbach is enough to show that it presents a rather curious spectacle Granted that Marx’s early works do not have to be taken into account(I know that this is to ask a concession which some people find difficult to accept, despite the force of the arguments I have put forward)</div></div>
